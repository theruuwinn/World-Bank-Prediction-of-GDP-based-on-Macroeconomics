# World-Bank-Prediction-of-GDP-based-on-Macroeconomics
Project Summary: Prediction of GDP based on Macroeconomics (World Bank Data)

•	Objective: Forecast a country's GDP using machine learning algorithms and macroeconomic indicators.

•	Dataset: World Bank's World Development Indicators (1960-2022), covering 268 countries and 48 variables.

•	Key Variables: Population density, inflation, government spending, trade in services, CO2 emissions, and more.

•	Machine Learning Models Used:
   o	Random Forest
   o	K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
   o	Logistic Regression
   o	Linear Regression
   o	Decision Tree Regression
   
•	Approach: Data pre-processing (imputation, correlation analysis, and visualization), feature selection, and model evaluation.

•	Key Findings:
   o	Identified correlations between macroeconomic factors and GDP.
   o	Predicted GDP with varying model performance and insights into key GDP drivers.
   o	Decision tree model used for classification based on government spending and population density.
   
•	Significance: Provides actionable insights for policymakers and investors for sustainable economic development.

•	Future Work: Incorporating time series analysis, ensemble learning, and external data for improved accuracy.
